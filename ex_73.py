            counter+=1
print (counter-1)
#the above range makes sure that the number is more than
#1/3 but does not make sure that the number is below 1/2
#for that purpose the CoPrime(i,d) takes care of it; how?
#take d=10 the range includes:5,4 but but 5 and 10 are not
#coprime so it will not be included and for d odd number
#the range is always below 1/2. Now the only fraction which
#is included is 1/2 which is not below 1/2 and is also
#coprime so we have to declude this fraction from the whole
