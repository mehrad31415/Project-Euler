"""example 21:
    Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors 
    of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
    If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b 
    are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called 
    amicable numbers.

    For example, the proper divisors of 220 are
    1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; 
    therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 
    are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

    Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under
    10000.

#not increase the speed of our algorithm that much
#because the number of amicable numbers is low
#for non-amicable numbers because they consist a high
#majority of the numbers it will increase the speed
#of our algorithm but it will not be correct to do so

#if we were to delete 1210 when not being amicable with
#1490 for instance we could not check it with 1184.
#(here 1184 is checked first and we do not encounter
